# Resources management-game
This is a console, turn-based simulation of game, where you can manage resources. It was developed during first year of my studies at Warsaw University of Technology.

You can download windows release in Releases section.

Basically, after running this game, you will have some resources, such as gold, steal, wood etc. You can build new factories, such as mines, farms etc. You will get resources in every round from each factory.
You can also hire workers - factory will generate proportional amount of resources to the amount of workers.

Remember to have enough food to feed the workers and gold to pay them. If you don't - they may mutiny (if they don't get paid) or even die (from hunger).

There might also happen some unpredictable events: good or bad. Someone can steal your money, your factory may have a breakdown or it can be even destroyed (with workers). But you can also get some resources by a miracle.
